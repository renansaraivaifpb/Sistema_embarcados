The light memory game, inspired by the classic Simon Game, is an embedded system that challenges players to remember and reproduce random sequences of lights (represented by LEDs) that are generated by the system.

The gameplay is simple: the system displays a sequence of lights, which increases in complexity with each round. The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the same order as the lights were displayed.

As the player progresses through the rounds, the difficulty increases, requiring ever greater concentration and memory to keep up with the sequences generated. The game continues until the player makes a mistake in reproducing the sequence, at which point the game ends.

The system can impose a limitation on the maximum size of the generated sequence, which makes the game challenging even for players with moderate memory skills, guaranteeing an engaging and exciting experience.
